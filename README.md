Basic Sinatra with User Authentication
=======================

How does one log into a website? In this exercise we're going to explore just that. Using sessions (with cookies) we'll be able to authenticate a user and know who's asking for information. Import the stories to get started.

This is VERY simple user authentication. Looking up resources will be hard, since the idea of authentication is much more complicated than this example. We'll get to this next week.

There are mockups representing what the website should look like located in the `mockups` folder. Please refer the the `.png` versions of the mockups. The `.bmml` are the raw mockups used to build the `png`s.
